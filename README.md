Create a content management system for Animals, Species, and Enclsoure.  I've created a simialr email marketing app with a database of influencers for an email marketing outreach challenge.


Edit animals
We have a zoo, and are computerizing our animal tracking system.

We need you to create an interface for inputting the animals manually.

The Challenge

Please build a rails app that allows you to add and edit animals in our system.

It should have the following models

Animal
Enclosure
Species
Animals (obviously) are part of species and belong in enclosures

You should be able to add and edit all of these, including any additional attributes that are necessary (names for the animals for example).

Furthermore, when creating animals or enclosures, you should be able to do assignment at creation (for example, an animal should be able to be added to an enclosure when you create it, and animals can be moved into a new enclosure at creation)
